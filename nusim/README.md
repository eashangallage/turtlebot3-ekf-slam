# nusim: A simulator for the turtlebot robot in ROS2

This package simulates a turtlebot robot with ROS2, using RVIZ for 
visualization. As of now, the package will place a turtlebot model 
in RVIZ at a specified pose. Additionally the user can specify an
arbitrary number of obstacles to also be placed into the
simulation/RVIZ window.
